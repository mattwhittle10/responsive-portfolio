                I was born and raised in Kaysville Utah. I grew up in a family of 4 kids, two boys and two girls. We grew up going camping a lot and enjoying the outdoors. Growing up I remember always go fourwheeling and camping in the mountains for the majority of our family vacations.

                I got married in July of 2014 and currently have two little boys that I love spending time with. We love to go fishing together. Our first boy is 2 years old and the second was just born. Some of my hobbies are playing soccer, fishing, riding motorcycles, and restoring and fixing classic cars & motorcycles.

                Currently I work at Fidelty Invesmtents. I have been working there for the past 4 years and have enjoyed it but am looking to pursue a career in software engineering and web design.
